Question 1: Write a pig script to find the first 3 (or less than 3) twitter handles mentioned in each tweet using regex_extract() function

a = load '/user/twitter/full_text' AS (id:chararray, ts:chararray, location:chararray, lat:float, lon:float, tweet:chararray);
b = foreach a generate CONCAT (id, ts) as tweetid, flatten(TOKENIZE(tweet)) as token;
b1 = FILTER b BY token matches '@USER_\\S{8}';
c = group b1 by tweetid;
d = foreach c generate flatten(group) as tweetid, b1.token, COUNT($1) as cnt;
e = FILTER d BY cnt < 4;
f = order e by cnt desc;
final = limit f 30;
dump final;

Question 2: Find 3 most popular topics (hashtags) in the full_text data

a = load '/user/twitter/full_text' AS (id:chararray, ts:chararray, location:chararray, lat:float, lon:float, tweet:chararray);
b = foreach a generate flatten(TOKENIZE(LOWER(tweet))) as token;
c = FILTER b BY token matches '#\\w\\w+';
d = group c by token;
e = foreach d generate flatten(group) as hash, COUNT($1) as cnt;
f = order e by cnt desc;
final = limit f 30;
dump final;

Top 3 hashtags:
(#ff,5790)
(#nowplaying,3004)
(#inhighschool,2760)
